# HN-Search

Hacker News (HN) can be defined as a mixture of both a news website and a forum. It is oriented towards presenting news related to technology and entrepreneurship. News are posted by HN users and the platform strives to guarantee good quality news, and dicussions generated from each of them.
HN uses a search engine powered by Algolia to allow users search over the posts. I have detected that the results returned by Algolia are not what is expected from a search engine that works over news. In this project I am going to explore and provide a way of improving the search results given certain characteristics of the posts.
